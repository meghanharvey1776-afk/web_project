	<p>These are the projects I created in the DIG2000 class. I learned so many things on how to create Photoshop images, Premiere Pro videos, and a website with HTML.</p>

	<h5>This is my photoshop image I created using photoshop. It was a much more tedious project than I thought and actually took me two tries to get to what it is because I kept messing up the contrast and ruining the image as a whole. It came out well I think in the end.</h5>

	<h5>This is my Stop Motion video I created with 150 photographs. Another tedious project, but once I got in the rhythm of moving the characters it became a lot faster process. This was a brisk 30 second project that makes me interested to try a more detailed, longer short film version of a stop motion feature.</h5>

<div class="section">
	<h5>This is my short film video I made with Premiere Pro. For this I wanted to do a sort of horrorish film. I created a character that was meant to be the sort of dark shadow of a person that lurks especially when home alone. I painted my neck and hands blacked out for the shadow effect then tried to put some details on my face as well. I think the concept could come out better another try, but it was still cool to try out!</h5>
